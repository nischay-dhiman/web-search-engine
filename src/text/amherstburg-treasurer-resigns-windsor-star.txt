Amherstburg treasurer resigns Back to video Chief administrative officer Mike Phipps said via email that he had no further comment on Beneteau’s resignation. Phipps did say that although Wendy Dade has been serving as acting treasurer “for quite some time,” administration will be recommending Justin Rousseau, the recently hired director of finance, be appointed treasurer. Phipps said he was hoping that would occur sometime next week. Rousseau reported the most current figures for the town’s debt at $46,694,492. Since early 2013, the town has wrestled with its debt and controversy over the town’s financial practices. Amherstburg has been in the midst of a financial reassessment for almost two years and recently received a financial management practices review facilitated by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. jkotsis@windsorstar.com [pn_facebook_like /] Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Amherstburg treasurer resigns Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Windsor Star Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Windsor Star, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.
