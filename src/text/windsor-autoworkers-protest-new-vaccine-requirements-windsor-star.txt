Article content “Standing up for our rights, our rights and freedoms,” said Matt Hallewick, who called himself an advocate supporting people at risk of losing their jobs over vaccine mandates. “It’s not about vaccines as many might think. We’re defending our rights and freedoms as Canadians. If we let this issue kill those rights we’re not going to have any rights left on the next issues.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Windsor autoworkers protest new vaccine requirements Back to video The automakers announced last week they are implementing mandatory vaccine policies for employees across Canada. The deadline for compliance is Dec. 17. Consequences for not complying could include termination. The new mandate covers about 4,500 workers at Windsor Assembly Plant and nearly 1,500 at Windsor’s two Ford engine plants.

Article content They were there to express their contempt for the new policies and anger at the union, which has said there is no recourse for employees who don’t comply and end up losing their jobs. Many carried signs with messages including “Unifor Discriminates,” “No Mandatory Vaccines,” “United Against Mandates,” and “My Body My Choice.” Several Windsor police officers showed up to keep an eye on the situation. “People have to understand the importance of this issue,” said Hallewick. “It’s about Canadian rights and freedoms and if we don’t stand for this now, we will not have those rights and freedoms later. This will be the precedent setting event that will trigger the erosion of our rights and freedoms as Canadians.” Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Windsor autoworkers protest new vaccine requirements Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Windsor Star Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Windsor Star, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.
