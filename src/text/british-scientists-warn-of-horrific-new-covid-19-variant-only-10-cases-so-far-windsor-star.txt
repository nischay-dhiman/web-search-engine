British scientists warn of 'horrific' new COVID-19 variant; only 10 cases so far Back to video Professor Francois Balloux, a geneticist at University College London, said the strain likely came from a lingering infection in a patient with a compromised immune system, possibly someone with undiagnosed AIDS. Dr. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College, who was the person to identify its spread, described the variant’s combination of mutations as “horrific.” Peacock warned that B.1.1.529, its scientific name, had the potential to be “worse than nearly anything else about,” including the dominant Delta strain. The good news is that scientists told the Mail its unprecedented number of mutations might make it “unstable,” and prevent it from becoming widespread.

They add there’s no need to be “overly concerned” because there were no signs yet that it was spreading rapidly but they are keeping an eye on it. Balloux told the Mail it was likely the variant would be much more able to dodge antibodies than Delta. “For the time being, it should be closely monitored. But there’s no need to be overly concerned unless it starts going up in frequency,” he said.
