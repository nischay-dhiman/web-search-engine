Report of person with gun sends Sandwich Secondary School in to 'hold and secure' mode Back to video Responding officers were told there had been an argument between two groups of people in the parking lot. A student who was not involved reported it to the principal, stating they overhead that one of the people involved possibly had a gun. Police suggested that school officials place the school in a hold and secure status pending further investigation. Officers tracked down the person who reportedly had a gun and searched him. They did not find a weapon, police said. Two males were issued trespass notices. Their parents were also notified of what happened. “The hold and secure status was activated out of an abundance of caution until investigators could determine what had transpired,” police said. “The investigation into this event revealed that there were no reports of any assault or threats on this date and there was no firearm present or involved.” Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Report of person with gun sends Sandwich Secondary School in to 'hold and secure' mode Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Windsor Star Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Windsor Star, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.
