Demolition begins on former Duffy's Tavern Back to video The first phase of the town’s waterfront project begins with the demolition of the popular former tavern and motel. The municipality hopes to have the site ready to host festivities connected with Canada 150’s Canuck It Up event Aug. 5-6. “This waterfront project will transform the landscape of Amherstburg’s downtown core,” DiCarlo said in a statement. The town purchased the property earlier this year for $1.1 million and awarded a demolition contract worth $280,000 to the Jones Group. After the site is cleared, opportunities for public consultation on its future shape will be announced.
