Canada's worst mass shooting helped push 2020 murder rate to 15-year high Back to video Canadian police reported 743 murders in 2020, up from 687 in 2019. The murder rate increased to 1.95 per 100,000 people, the highest in 15 years. “While homicide continues to be a relatively rare occurrence, representing less than 0.2% of all violent crimes in Canada in 2020, homicide rates are considered benchmarks for levels of violence,” Statscan said in a commentary. By comparison, the overall U.S. murder rate in 2020 was around 6.5 homicides per 100,000 people, according to FBI data. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Gabriel Wortman killed 13 people in Nova Scotia on the night of April 18, 2020, and another nine the next day before police shot him dead. This contributed to an “uncharacteristically high homicide count and rate for the province,” Statscan said. The two most populated cities in Alberta, Calgary and Edmonton, recorded large increasesD, and each contributed 15 more murders to the national tally than in 2019. There were 15 more firearm-related killings in Canada last year, compared with 2019, and gang-related murders decreased 10% in the same period.
